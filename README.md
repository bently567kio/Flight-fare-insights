Highly Rated Flights vs. Price Correlation

Higher-rated flights often come at a premium price. This suggests that passengers value superior service, comfort, and overall experience enough to pay more. Airlines can leverage this trend to enhance their premium offerings.

Cancellations Due to Negative Reviews

Poor ratings directly influence cancellations. This demonstrates how customer dissatisfaction leads to significant losses. Airlines may need to rework service quality or compensation strategies to prevent negative feedback from escalating into cancellations.

Financial Loss in Refunds

Refund amounts from canceled flights due to bad ratings highlight the monetary downside of poor service. Airlines may want to revise refund policies or focus on improving customer satisfaction to minimize financial loss.

Ticket Cancellation Peaks Each Month

Understanding the exact date with the highest cancellations per month helps predict patterns and potential causes. Airlines could implement targeted marketing or operational adjustments during peak cancellation periods.

Highest Fare Airlines

Airlines charging above ₹50,000 likely operate premium routes, long-haul international flights, or provide exclusive services. Competitive pricing and high-end service differentiation can further justify these fares.

Lowest Fare Airlines

Flights priced under ₹25,000 indicate budget-friendly services, regional routes, or airlines offering promotional deals. This pricing strategy attracts cost-conscious travelers but may come at the expense of additional amenities.

Cities with Maximum Bookings

Popular booking destinations reveal travel demand concentration. Airlines can optimize route planning, pricing, and capacity management to efficiently cater to high-traffic locations.
